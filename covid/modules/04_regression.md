## Section 4 - Statistics and Prediction

## Data Science 101

Once we have explored our dataset, examined summary statistics and visualized the dataset, we can analyze the data using statistical functions from the [scipy module](https://www.scipy.org/) and make predictions with the [scikit-learn module](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). These techniques and models are part of data science, which is a [broad and developing field](https://datascience.berkeley.edu/about/what-is-data-science/) consisting of various steps in managing, storing, analyzing and communicating data.

Statistical and prediction models are typically used to analyze data. For example, in this notebook we fit a linear regression model to analyze the relationship between route incidents and vehicle delay.

The prediction model example in this section is based on this Medium article [tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-guide-to-linear-regression-in-python-with-scikit-learn-83a8f7ae2b4f)
