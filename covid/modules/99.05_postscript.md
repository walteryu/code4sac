## Postscript: It's Okay to Experiment!
In Notebook you can always add new cells, or copy existing cells for tweaking -- want to try something new? Just create or copy/paste a new cell, experiment, tweak, break, fix, and edit as needed. Your original data is safe (e.g. in your CSV file, remember we first imported it into Python/Notebook), and you can always delete cells or start over by restarting the Python/Notebook kernel via the Kernel menu (warning: this will clear whatever you've computed in Notebook for this session, but it won't affect your Notebook code or the original data in your CSV file).

## Postscript: Searching for Help Online

Notebook, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn... all of these have extensive resources online and Google is your friend.

An important tip for finding answers online is to use the right tech keyword with your question.

For example, you might ask *How do I sort my dataframe?* For this question, a good search would be "pandas sort dataframe". Here "pandas" is the 'right' tech keyword, whereas "notebook sort dataframe" may not return the best results.

The 'right' tech keyword is often the module you're working with, so if you're doing things with dataframes, it's pandas, if you're plotting, it's matplotlib or seaborn, etc.
