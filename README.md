### Introduction

This repository contains my projects for [Code for Sacramento](https://codeforsacramento.org/) with focus on data science.

Code for Sacramento is a [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/) brigade which volunteers its time to develop projects for non-profits and local municipalities using open-source technologies.
