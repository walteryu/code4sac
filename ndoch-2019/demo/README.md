# NDoCH 2019 - Group Demo  

### Code for Sacramento - September 2019

## Introduction

The group demo continued work from the tutorial provided as part of the CA Open Data track focusing on annual traffic delay data from the [CA Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/). Description and details about the dataset are available [here](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/caltrans-annual-vehicle-delay). The group continued analysis by adding CARB 2017 vehicle [emission data](https://www.arb.ca.gov/emfac/2017/) for Sacramento County.

## Team Members

The team consisted of the members below and their roles in the demo:

* Dan Fey - Web scraping of CARB website; script attached for reference
* Neil Horning - Data analysis between datasets and notebook preparation on [Github](https://github.com/Nhorning/code4sac/blob/master/ndoch-2019/NDoCH_Notebook_Tutorial.ipynb)
* Lindsay Poirier - Identify dataset, assist with analysis and documentation

## Findings

Data exploration showed that the dataset consists of vehicle type, fuel type, traffic count, vehicle speed, model year and pollutant type. Data visualization was completed using scatter and pair plots to evaluate data distribution and trends between attributes. Additional analysis needs to be completed for data exploration and cleanup with the CARB dataset for comparison.
