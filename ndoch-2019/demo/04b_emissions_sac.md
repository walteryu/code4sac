## Emissions Analysis

Building on the vehicle traffic analysis, we will analyze CARB 2017 vehicle [emission data](https://www.arb.ca.gov/emfac/2017/) for Sacramento County. Data exploration showed that the dataset consists of vehicle type, fuel type, traffic count, vehicle speed, model year and pollutant type. Data visualization was completed using box plots for basic parameters and scatterplots for larger parameters.
