###

This repository contains the initial Jupyter notebook/analysis for the CA Workforce data analysis project which was presented at the GARE data workgroup kick-off in October 2019. The project supports the CalEPA Race and Equity project per citation in the section below. This project is intended to analyze CA workforce data to identify trends in state employment.

### Objectives

The project objectives are as follows:

1. Identify, validate and analyze CA workforce data
2. Develop dataset inventory of CA workforce data
3. Identify questions to be answered with data analysis
4. Engage with entire GARE workgroup to improve the data resources
5. Analyze data to identify trends across employee rank, ethnicity and organization
6. Document findings and propose recommendations to improve race/gender quality

### Methodology

The initial [datasets](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/calhr-civil-rights-data-for-gare-capital-cohort-2019) for this project were sourced from CalHR by the Water Board. The datasets provide information on employee classification, organization, ethnicity and gender. Additional datasets will be added as the project develops; future data may incorporate the following:

1. Census Data - How does employment trends correlate with wider census data trends?
2. Education Data - Do relationships exist between race, gender and education?
3. Job Data - How does employment trends correlate with wider job data trends?

### Installation

1. Install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) from the command line or with the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) application
2. Verify that Jupyter Notebook was installed; it should start by running `jupyter notebook` from the command line or be visible from Windows Start menu
3. Start Jupyter Notebook; save this notebook and CSV data to your "Documents" folder and navigate to it from the Notebook start page
4. Open this notebook from the start page; file and cells should be viewable
