# NDoCH 2019 - Jupyter Notebook Tutorial

### Code for Sacramento - September 2019

## Instructions

1. Install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) from the command line or with the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) application
2. Verify that Jupyter Notebook was installed; it should start by running `jupyter notebook` from the command line or be visible from Windows Start menu
3. Start Jupyter Notebook; save this notebook and CSV data to your "Documents" folder and navigate to it from the Notebook start page
4. Open this notebook from the start page; file and cells should be viewable

## Introduction

This tutorial demonstrates basic Notebook functionality, Python code required to run examples and features for analysis and visualization. It will require some basic understanding of the Python programming language, Jupyter platform and data analysis; however, we will work through these steps in each section so not to worry! After this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Notebook, Python and how to get started with your own notebook.

This tutorial focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of annual traffic delay data from the [CA Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/). Description and details about the dataset are available [here](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/caltrans-annual-vehicle-delay).

Citation: This notebook is based on this Medium article [tutorial](https://medium.com/python-pandemonium/introduction-to-exploratory-data-analysis-in-python-8b6bcb55c190) and [Github Repo](https://github.com/kadnan/EDA_Python/).

## Notebooks for Collaboration

Notebook is a powerful collaborative tool which is open-source and light-weight. It provides all the tools necessary to run data analysis, visualization, statistics and data science [out of the box](https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book/01/what-is-data-science.html). In addition, it's gained acceptance from industry and academia for collaborating on projects and publishing work.

Notebook is a combination of text and code with the programming run-time built into the platform so there is no need to install additional software. The text is in the markdown file format (similar to HTML), and code supports several languages. It is organized by cells which can consist of either text or code; placed together, they can be sent as a single document to share/publish work.

## The Python Programming Language

This tutorial will cover some basic programming, so we will focus on learning the Python programming language for this notebook since it is widely used in industry and has even gained enough traction to be taught in [high school](https://codehs.com/info/curriculum/intropython) and AP Computer Science [courses](https://code.org/educate/curriculum/high-school).

[Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) supports several different languages (R, Scala and Julia); however, Python is the most popular of them and can be used for other tasks, primarily data science and web programming.
