## Section 3 - Data Visualization

## Matplotlib is the New Chart Function

Rather than manually creating and updating charts in Excel, Python (its Matplotlib module) can plot data programmatically so that plots can easily be recreated and manipulated when the data changes. In addition, plot types are not bound by those available on Excel but updated over time from the open-source community. Plots can easily handle large datasets (e.g. > 100k rows) with many more plotting options than in Excel.

The links below will provide additional info but in general, plots are created programmatically by specifying the plot type, dataset and options (if any). Plots are output within the notebook and can also be exported as a separate file (e.g. png or pdf).
